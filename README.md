# 4TU.RD in a nutshell - Submission for the R Caf√© plot-a-thon

This repository contains the R script `script.R` used to produce the visualisation 
for the plot-a-thon. The comments in the scripts are meant to underpin some of the 
decisions taken during the exploration of the dataset and to show the steps
taken in producing the visualisation, included in the repository as a `PNG` file.

View and download counts have not been used in this version of the visualisation.
